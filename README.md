# Noah Tomkins - Lab 6 - Grade Application

## Getting started

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Run `yarn add react-bootstrap bootstrap` to install bootstrap node_modules
3. Run the application, either for development or build
    * Development: `yarn start`
    * Build: `yarn build`

### Build

If you choose to build the application you must copy folder `build` to `public_html` on the server.

There is already a built version on my website here: https://grades.tnoah.ca/
